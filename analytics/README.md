# Code Challenge: Data Analysis and Visualization

Analytics is about more than just numbers! At ICX, we take a holistic view of analysis, which includes gathering and interacting with data, performing statistical analyses, creating visualizations, and telling stories. For this challenge, you'll get to show off your end-to-end analytics chops! Here are the steps:

## Clone the Repository

```bash
  $ git clone git@github.com:icxmedia/code-challenges.git
  $ cd code-challenges  
  $ cd analytics    
```
## Launch the Notebook
In Jupyter, open the file called "nba_player_stats.ipynb"

```bash
  $ jupyter notebook nba_player_stats.ipynb 
```

## Download the Data
NBA 2014 Players Dataset: [http://bit.ly/2n9twqX](http://bit.ly/2n9twqX)

## Load the Data and Perform Statistical Analysis
Given a dataset of NBA players performance and salary in 2014, use Python to load the dataset (e.g. using the `csv` module or `pandas`) and compute the summary statistics for the `SALARY` field:

- mean
- median
- mode
- minimum
- maximum

## Data Visualization and Storytelling
Then, create a custom visualization (using whichever Python library or libraries you like), and with accompanying text, describe the relationship of player efficiency (PER) to salary.

## Save and Send!
Save your new version of the notebook and send it back to us, either via a Gist link or an email.
